# KodeKloud

Launch a Terraform + AWS playground. Extend it immediately.

On the remote terminal
```bash
cat ../.aws/credentials
```

On your machine

```bash
aws configure --profile kodekloud

aws_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key
us-east-1
```

I had a weird issue where I have to name what profile I am using, so i've hardcoded it as kodekloud and its in the env file and referenced

Done!
